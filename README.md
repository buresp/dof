# Depth of field effects (realtime bokeh)

## The goal of this project

The goal is to implement a realtime bokeh effect in a realtime 3D scene according to the chosen parameters.

The result should be as close as possible to the well known bokeh, often seen in professional photos.


## Current state of the art

Rendering each pixel as a point sprite was used in the Witcher 2 as seen in this [article](https://bartwronski.com/2014/04/07/bokeh-depth-of-field-going-insane-part-1/).

Scatter techniques are also a possibility according to this [article](https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/bokeh/).

## My experience
I have a little of (mostly forgotten) experience in OpenGL, putting together a simple scene.

No experience with Direct3D, so I will be starting from scratch with a template project.


## Resources

## The plan

-Research

-Figuring out Direct3D and setting up the scene

-Adding depth of field effect capability

-Effect customization and experimenting
